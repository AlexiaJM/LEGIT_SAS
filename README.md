# LEGIT_SAS
SAS macros for the Latent Environmental &amp; Genetic InTeraction (LEGIT) model

R package vs SAS macro: The R package LEGIT provides similar functions but the implementation is incredibly faster. In R, it is also much easier to set the model properly with a single formula instead of in 4 parts. The stepwise search function in R is also much better and does it for multiple steps (instead of just one step in SAS) and either does it automatically or let you enter an interactive mode where you choose which variable to add at every step based on the information shown to you. The only thing that the R package cannot do is mixed models. Therefore, for fixed-effect models I recommend using R exclusively and for mixed models, I recommend using the stepwise search function in R to find the best subset of variables assuming no random effects and then refitting the best model in SAS with the random effects.
